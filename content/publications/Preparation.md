Stimuli  Sensitive  hydrogels  have  enormous  potential  in  various  applications.  Various environmental variables are found in the body, such as low pH and elevated temperatures. For this reason, either  pH-sensitive  and/or  temperature-sensitive  hydrogels  can  be  used  for  site-specific controlled drug delivery. For many applications hydrogels require a very rapid time-response in terms of their sensitivity to either pH and/or temperature. Rapid time-responsive sensitivity is a research field which is still in development. In this research pH-sensitive hydrogels have been made varying the composition and molecular weight of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). After total  dissolution  of  the  PVA/PAA  the  hydrogel  was  freeze/thawed.  The  swelling  responses  were investigated as well as the drug release profile with varying pH. The drug release was studied with a model drug theophylline. The characteristic properties were examined with ac impedance. The results showed that the optimum formulation to be used as a stimulus sensitive hydrogel is found with lower concentration of PVA and a higher concentration of PAA. These PVA/PAA hydrogels have potential in biomedical applications
