The aim of this study was to evaluate the trochlear bone and cartilaginous regeneration of rabbits using the association of PRP, chitosan, and hydroxyapatite. Hole was made in rabbit troches, one hole in each animal remained empty (group C), and one was filled by a combination of PRP, chitosan, and hydroxyapatite (group T). Clinical-orthopedic, radiographic, and histomorphometric evaluations were performed. Clinical-orthopedic evaluation showed lameness of two members of the T group and one member of group C. The radiographic evaluation showed that the T group showed absence of subchondral bone reaction (33%). The presence of moderate subchondral bone reaction was more frequently reported in group C with 67%. Microscopic evaluation revealed a presence of tissue neoformation, composed of connective tissue. Microscopic findings were similar in both groups, with a difference in the amount of neoformed tissue being perceptible, which was confirmed after the morphometric analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the quantity of newly formed tissue at the bone/cartilage/implant interface. The composite base of the association of chitosan, hydroxyapatite, and platelet-rich plasma favored bone and cartilage healing.
