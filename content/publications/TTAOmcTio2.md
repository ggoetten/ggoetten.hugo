Anodic oxidation is a technique widely used to improve the bioactivity of Ti surface. In this study, micro-arc oxidation (MAO) was used to obtain an anodic film incorporating Ca and P ions to evaluate the effect of heat and hydrothermal treatment on the mechanical and in vitro bioactivity properties of these new layers. The MAO process was carried out using (CH3COO)2Ca·H2O and NaH2PO4·2H2O electrolytes under galvanostatic mode (150mA/cm2). The thermal treatments were made at 400°C and 600°C in air atmosphere while hydrothermal treatment was made in an alkaline water solution at 130°C. These surfaces presented desired mechanical properties for biomedical applications owing to the rutile and anatase phases in the anodic film that are more crystalline after thermal treatments; which provided an increase in hardness values and lower elastic modulus. The dry sliding wear resistance increased by performing thermal treatments on the surfaces with one condition still maintaining the film after the test. Bioactivity was investigated by immersion in simulated body fluid during 21 days and hydroxyapatite was formed on all samples. Finally, lower values of contact angle were obtained for heat treated samples.
