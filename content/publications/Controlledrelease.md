With increasing technologies for drug development, the demand to improve bioavailability of poorly-water soluble drugs have been gathered many interest. The low bioavailability and toxicity with these drugs focused the research to develop different strategies to counter its effects. In this chapter, we will aim to look at the problems on the different formulations and delivery routes with poorly water soluble drugs. In addition, we introduce solutions to overcome the problems of poorly-water soluble drugs by describing the influence of biodegradable hydrogels; the technology development and treatment, which has led to innovations in the field. Finally, we describe the recent advances of hydrogels on the use of stimuli responsive. Classification of stimuli responsive hydrogels can be mostly divided in to two groups physical stimuli and chemical. Temperature and pH stimuli are the most popular amounts stimuli responsive hydrogels. Stimuli responsive hydrogels that can be used as in situ forming hydrogels have great potential in biomedical applications for target controlled drug delivery
