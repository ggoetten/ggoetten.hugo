Innovations on the field of smart hydrogels are now being held with loads of advantages. With recent progress, smart polymers can now be used on the market for specific target/objectives desired on medicine. However, the field of smart hydrogels has not been fully overviewed on the ground for drug delivery. In this study, a novel pH-sensitive smart hydrogel for drug delivery was investigated. Polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) with polyacrylic acid (PAA) was blended adding synthetic hydroxyapatite (Hap) with freeze-thawed cycles and its effects were studied in terms of mechanical strength, bioactivity, and drug release profile. Mechanical strength towards compression tests was decreased after addition of Hap and storage modulus (G') increased. Bioactivity was confirmed after 14 days on simulated body fluid (SBF). Improvement of swelling and gel fraction with the addition of Hap throughout the polymer matrix. Moreover, a study was performed with theophylline-loaded samples for drug-delivery studies.
