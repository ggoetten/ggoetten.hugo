Extracted propolis has been used for a long time as a remedy. However, if the release rate of propolis is not controlled, the efficacy is reduced. To overcome this issue, extracted propolis was added to a cryogel system. Propolis collected from southern Brazil was extracted using different methods and loaded at different concentrations into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyacrylic acid hydrogels as carrier systems. The material properties were investigated with a focus on the propolis release profiles and the cryogel antibacterial properties against 4 different bacteria, namely: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas putida. Swelling studies indicated that the swelling of the hydrogel was inversely related to propolis content. In addition, propolis release studies indicated a decreased release rate with increased propolis loading. PVA and PVA/polyacrylic acid–loaded propolis were effective against all 4 bacteria studied. These results indicate that the efficacy of propolis can be enhanced by incorporation into hydrogel carrier systems and that hydrogels with higher concentrations of propolis can be considered for use as bactericide dressing.
