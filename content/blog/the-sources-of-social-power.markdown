Just recently I noticed the large amount of research on webometrics, scientometrics and how important are these [findings](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23301643). One that particularly attracts me is the [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) usage and its stats, as an old Mendeley user I know the benefits of the platform for citations and always thought that using these informations to extract data from all researchers who uses them might lead to interesting facts. Although Mendeley is not a reading library, I personally do not consider that as a reading library because it lacks a proper organization of your papers, it does have some interesting features as select by year or by journal but that is also limited. Either way, some studies on [Mendeley usage](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23909) and [feedback](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23286) have been shown to support that Mendeley can be used as early impact indicator because the most relevant indicator - citation metric - for any paper takes time to gather. Just as a logic argument, I would say that Mendeley might not be a great argument of importance for your work, which is based on how many people have your paper in their libraries. I know many researchers who only add the articles they want to Mendeley when they need to cite it properly. Perhaps due to the lack of useful features on Mendeley and a proper library. Either way, most of these studies addresses these facts and explain the limitations of this study; one of the problems could be because it is that is owned by [Elsevier](https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2016/12/12/why-i-still-wont-review-for-or-publish-with-elsevier-and-think-you-shouldnt-either/), which is not well received by many [researchers](http://thecostofknowledge.com/).

From the data gathered in these studies, recent articles are only added to the reader personal Mendeley database after some weeks, and each journal with their specific issues - periodic releases of the journal throughout the year - seems to follow the same pattern. The most interesting case is seen when there is a rise in adding recent papers to personal mendeley database after the article is catalogued into a specific issue of the journal. This, in my opinion, could be that the paper is not within the aesthetic and style of the journal and the reader decide to look after these have been performed by the editorial team of the journal. Another interesting aspect is the fact that the majority of people who uses Mendeley are [young and constitute more than 50% of Ph.D. students](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23286) followed by postgrad and postdoc; this graph is visible across all major areas. I strongly suggest to check this [read](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23286) on which Larivi√®re group discuss in extremely detail the reasoning behind the readers audience.

Surely supporting on only one type of reference manager software can be biased since there are also many researchers who uses zotero or CiteULIke etc.. A major contribution would be gathering the data of all these softwares and maybe compare and correlate. However, Mendeley is a fairly easy software to use and very intuitive so it can indeed give notable feedback on its data usages.
