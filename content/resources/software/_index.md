<h2>Softwares List - updated on 09-2018</h2>

<p> This section is designed to give some helpful suggestions for academic material, mostly for engineers. I tend to test many softwares and different packages for not only to make the researh I perform more aesthetically pleasant but also more professional. Trougought my carrer, I've come to observe that many students and research colleagues do not look for different softwares that ables them to perform/show their results effectively and in a different way. So this page comes with the insight of showing that using different packages is not only useful but at the same time exciting. There are hundreds of interesting software but I will list the ones I frequently use, free and are somewhat not common</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nashamri/academic-phrases">**Auto completion academic phrases**</a> - This software helps in showing some related and known academic phrases for specific parts of your manuscript. It is very useful if you are stuck in the beginning of a sentence because you dont know how to start.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/amperser/proselint">**Proselint**</a> - Help improve your text. Very handy!

<h3>Markdown Editors</h3>

Markdown Editors are useful not only due to the many instances they can be applied, like this website, but the most interesting aspect of Markdown Editors to me is the minimalist template where you can write very concentrated and helping focus on writing that difficult paper of yours. Many researchers are now using markdown to write their papers, I will give a<a href="https://medium.com/thoughts-philosophy-writing/writing-an-academic-paper-in-plain-text-and-sharing-everywhere-part-iv-of-the-series-774b4c02fe6f"> link of a researcher who gives an insight on the particularities of it, I suggest reading the four parts of his series</a>. From these softwares I recommend: <a href="https://typora.io">**Typora**</a> and <a href="https://atom.io">**Atom**</a>, which are free. Each with their own particularities, <a href="http://typora.io">**Typora**</a> is a WYSIWYG editor, the differences between them is that Typora let you visualize the code with a single click mouse and embbed figures easily. On the other hand, for coding, myself personally, use <a href="https://atom.io">**Atom**</a> which have loads of community packages which you can auto-install inside the software without being afraid of broken it or doing too much effort. However, Atom is also used by many researchers for the writing aspect and due to the community packages it has the auto citation package using zotero, can also be used to write latex maths and many other features.

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>Apart from common math softwares (wolframalpha, R) I use some portable softwares to handle easy calculation without the need of using heavy softwares.</p>

<a href="http://physics.gac.edu/~huber/error_calc/">**Error_calc**</a> - Software for error propagation. ALtought, most of these advanced math softwares can do it. This one is portable and very intuitive to calculate the propagation of any value; this software is developed by Thomas Huber from Physics Department of Gustavus Adolphus College. THere are many software for error propagation, a highly recommended<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uncertainty_propagation_software">list of uncertainty propagation softwares can be found on wikipedia</a>

<a href="http://speedcrunch.org">**SpeedCrunch**</a> - For doing simple Math calculation I tend to use a portable software named SpeedCrunch. It has many features and very lightweight so any device can handle.

<h3>Data handling and statistics</h3>

For most of the simple data I use a major software and for those that identifies compounds I use specific softwares. I will list here the freeware versions of the ones I normally use.

<a href="http://www.qtiplot.com">**Qtiplot**</a> - Altought this software is not free per-se, the binary distributions are freeware and the researchers team from <a href="https://intranet.cells.es/Members/cpascual/docs/unofficial-qtiplot-packages-for-windows">ALBA synchrotron releases each two years a stable version from the binaries</a>. If you dont want to compile from scratch and do all the necessary steps to install this software then I recommend download and use the software they provide. I have been using it for years and like its competitor (origin) it has many features for plotting, fitting, statistics and all in all is a must have for me, while it also have a portable package.

<a href="https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/">**Spectraglyph**</a> - FTIR software For analyse the spectra of FTIR/Raman I use a new software named spectraglyph developed by Friedrich Menges which I gladly helped him finish his project. Friedrich has been working constantly in this software and not only can do the basic tasks of finding peaks, fitting multi peak data as stacked graphs which is not that easy to do with conventional data handling softwares and can also now identify the peaks if you have a database (any database can work).

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/">**PSPP**</a> - This software for statistics is relatively known but very powerful and easy to work with. I really suggest using it for stats calculation.

<a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">**imageJ**</a> -  is perhaps the easiest software to work in quantifying elements based on a set of image data. The amount of plugins and packages for this software is huge and it is possible to calculate many different properties based on the output you have.

<h3>Image processing</h3>

<a href="https://www.gimp.org/">**GIMP**</a> - For most of the images I use gimp, which is a really powerful software and there are still a lot of functions there to learn. It can definetely process the images you have and improve the quality. HIghly recommended.

<h3>Presentation Slides</h3>
<a "https://revealjs.com/">**revealjs**</a> - This one is perhaps one of the hardest and maybe the most intriguing software I have recently worked with. It allows to obtain very unique slides making your presentation superpass your objectives. Highly recommended. If the coding is a bit too hard, you can give the online version <a href="https://slides.com">**Slides**</a> a try, which some templates of it are free.

<a "https://yhatt.github.io/marp/">**marp**</a> - marp is a slide software and it has two themes. This version is now abandoned by the dev and a new one is actually coming this year. I used to prepare some slides with it using Markdown which is relatively simple doing from it. I will update the list when the new software comes out.

<h3>To-do and Task Management</h3>
<a "https://calcurse.org/">**calcurse**</a> - This app lets you add to-do's and appointments on the linux terminal environment and is really intuitive. It also has support for CalDav which is able to sync with known caldendars like google agenda.

<a "https://www.wunderlist.com/">**Wunderlist**</a> - Wunderlist is probably well known but I really use this software to manage my students for them to read some specific papers, complete tasks and is very easy to work with.

<a "https://www.notion.so/">**Notion**</a> - Altought not completely free, I just recently came across this software and I think the organization and the structure of this app is great and everyone should check.
