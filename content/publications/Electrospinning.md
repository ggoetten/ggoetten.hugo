<p>The field of biomedical applications for hydrogels requires the development of nanostructures with specific controlled diameter and mechanical properties. Nanofibers are ideal candidates for these advanced requirements, and one of the easiest techniques that can produce one-dimensional nanostructured materials in fibrous form is the electrospinning process. This technique provides extremely thin fibers with controlled diameter and highly porous microstructure with interconnected pores. Electrospinning demonstrates extreme versatility allowing the use of different polymers for tailoring properties and applications. It is a simple cost-effective method for the preparation of scaffolds. In this section, we will discuss recent and specific applications with a focus on their mechanisms. As such, we conclude this section with a discussion on perspectives and future possibilities on this field.</p>
