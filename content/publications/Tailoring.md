The following chapter gives an overview on the anodic layers and nanotubes produced with plasma electrolytic oxidation. An introduction into the mechanisms involved in producing these nanofilms, such as the required processing  parameters including voltage, current and time are discussed. In addition to an examination into the relation and the requirements for a good interface between the implant using these nanofilms and the bone, we also investigate and discuss the available commercial implants employing nanofilms.  Commercial applications have enormous potential and are an area of interest for future work. Finally, we discuss the mechanical properties and the improvements obtained on these nanofilms by the scientific community.
