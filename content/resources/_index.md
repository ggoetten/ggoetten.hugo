<h4><a href="/resources/software">Academic Softwares</a> &rarr;</h4>
<p>This is a list of interesting software I collected, and use, to improve my research. It goes from office softwares to math. A little description as to why I recommend is also included. I will keep an habit of updating this list from time to time. This version is from 09-2018</p>

<h4><a href="http://github.com/ggoetten/ggoetten.hugo/">Interested in the layout of my Website?</a> &rarr;</h4>
<p>This site is produced using <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a very fast static site generator, which you can <a href="http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/">read more about here</a>. The style was followed mostly by <a href="http://kieranhealy.org/">Kieran Healy</a>. Deploying a website with Hugo is not difficult and little HTML is needed, if you want, fork <a href="http://kjhealy.github.com/ggoetten.hugo/" title="This website"> on GitHub and modify as you see fit</a>, also share your variations of style with others in the same way I did, and professor Kieran, to help the community. Feel free to adapt it yourself. Also, modify the Google Analytics information in the footer partial.</p>
