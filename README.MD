kieranhealy.hugo

This is the code and much of the content for my website, http://ggoetten.githu.io. This site was forked from http://kieranhealy.org, which made a modified version of another website template from professor Greg Restall http://consequently.org. Greg used Hugo, a very fast static site generator written by Steve Francia, and Kube CSS framework to provide his interface.
If you do any modification, fork it and share with the community as well
